This project explains about Creating dashboards in Excel 
Dashboards in Excel are a great way to visualize data and communicate key insights in a clear, interactive format. Interactive dashboards provide a dynamic view of data. They combine visualizations like charts, graphs, and tables. The users can interact with dashboards to filter, drill down, and explore data. Dashboards enhance communication and data storytelling.
